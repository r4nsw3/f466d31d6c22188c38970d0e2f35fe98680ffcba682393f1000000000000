  |   The Master and Nero, who won the Holy Grail War and were awarded      |
  |   the "Regalia," a ring that proves their kingship, rule over the       |
  |   Servants they once fought against and start a new beginning on the    |
  |   moon's new world.                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   However, the team led by Tamamo, who held "another Regalia" with      |
  |   "another Master," and the team led by Altera, "destroyer of           |
  |   civilization," stood before them.                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The battle over the fate of the moon's world that unfolded as         |
  |   anticipated settled, and peace should have come to the world,         |
  |   but...                                                                |

  |   Set in the world of Extella, the story of a new Servant named         |
  |   Charlemagne will unfold.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * A New Story Centered on New Servant Charlemagne - A carefree        |
  |     young man who rather bluntly says he is not very well suited to     |
  |     be king. He decides his actions and aesthetic based on "whether     |
  |     it's cool" or "whether it's tacky." Even if it's bad for himself,   |
  |     or bad for his Master                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Reborn Action and Graphics: High-Speed Servant Action - A further   |
  |     enhanced system with evolved graphics and controls centered on      |
  |     Servant-based action. A new battle of Servants will unfold in the   |
  |     next version of the moon world                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * All 16 Servants from Fate/Extella are Playable - In addition to     |
  |     all 16 playable Servants from Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star, new    |
  |     Servants will also be playable. Defeat thousands of enemies with    |
  |     overwhelming power beyond human understanding                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * New Outfits for the "Master," the Player Avatar - The "Master" is   |
  |     the protagonist and player character, and together with their       |
  |     Servant will spin a new tale. Not only can you choose from a male   |
  |     or female Master, since you can also freely change their name, an   |
  |     offshoot of the player themselves will appear in the game           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The Moon's World - The territory ruled over by Nero and Tamamo is   |
  |     even more wonderful and gorgeous. And newer than that, buildings    |
  |     reminiscent of churches seem to be appearing. A new area will       |
  |     also appear. It appears to float in midair and seems to be able     |
  |     to freely move around                                               |
  |                                                                         |
